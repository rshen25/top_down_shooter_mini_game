# Top Down Shooter Mini Game
A Top down Shooter mini game with rogue-lite elements, inspired by games like The Binding of Isaac, Enter the Gungeon, Rogue Legacy, etc.

This project is mainly a way for me to learn how to use Unreal Engine 4 and to further develop my skills as a software developer.

# Planned features
- Multiple enemies and bosses
- Different floors with varying difficulty
- Items that boost stats and/or change the player's projectiles
